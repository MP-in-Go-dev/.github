# MP-in-Go-dev

This organization is focused on centralizing some of the tools used to 
perform Mathematical Programming in the Go (Golang) language. It aims to 
create a universal interface for performing optimization (like YALMIP) and 
to share simple wrappers for common optimization programs like Gurobi.
