# MatProGo-dev

This organization is focused on centralizing some of the tools used to 
perform Mathematical Programming in the [Go](https://go.dev/) (Golang) language. It aims to 
create a universal interface for performing optimization (like [YALMIP](https://github.com/yalmip/YALMIP)) and 
to share simple wrappers for common optimization programs like Gurobi.
